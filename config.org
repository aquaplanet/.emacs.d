* INITIALIZE THE WORLD OF EMACS
  This is my initialization file for Emacs. This file is bootstrapped
  from init.el. Init.el does the following:
  
  - Compare config.el and config.org. If .el is older than .org the
    .org file is tangled to config.el.
  - Load config.el
  - Creates a save hook that tangles this file whenever it is saved.

  The source code for the init.el can be found on
  [http://www.holgerschurig.de/en/emacs-init-tangle/]
